    do NOT, I repeat, NOT, send messages or use deletedObject in any other way than
    removing a reference to it or cleanup in a containing class (that has an __unsafed_unretained
    reference to it). If you call into it, the deletedObject is in the process of getting dealloc called on
    it so your code WILL crash and you will also crash all the interwebs. So there. You've been warned.
    
    for example, this is bad.
    
    - (void) myDeletedCallback:(FLDeletedObjectReference*) deletedObjectReference {
        [deletedObjectReference.deletedObject doSomethingThatWillCrash];
    }
    
    for example, this is ok

    - (void) myDeletedCallback:(FLDeletedObjectReference*) deletedObjectReference {
        
        if(myUnsafedUnretainedReference == deletedObjectReference.deletedObject) {
            myUnsafedUnretainedReference = nil;
        }

            [NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:deletedObjectReference.deletedObject]];
