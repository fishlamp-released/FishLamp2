title: About This Site
---

This site (help.fishlamp.com) is hosted on [github.com](http://github.com) in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/fishlamp/FishLamp/tree/gh-pages) branch of the FishLamp framework.

It is built with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), so that we have static pages written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

It uses the awesome [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) css library from twitter, so that it is a responsive site that works well on mobile devices.

This way of building the site makes it super fast and flexible. And we can add content to it using tools on our desktop and manage the content using git.

Nice.
